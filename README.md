# Gastronomy-insights
This repository analyzes restaurant data to uncover insights into dining trends, ratings, and services like table booking and online delivery. The project explores key features such as price range, city distribution, and restaurant performance. Various visualizations and feature engineering techniques are applied for deeper understanding.

Data Exploration and Preprocessing
Objective: Explore the dataset to understand its structure and clean the data.
Steps:
1. Load the dataset and check its basic structure (rows and columns).
2. Check for missing values and handle them accordingly.
3. Convert data types as necessary for analysis.
4. Analyze the distribution of the target variable (Aggregate Rating) to check for imbalances.


Descriptive Analysis
Objective: Perform basic descriptive analysis on the dataset.
Steps:
1. Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical columns.
2. Explore categorical variables like Country Code, City, and Cuisines.
3. Identify the top cities and cuisines with the highest number of restaurants.


Feature Engineering
Objective: Extract new features from existing columns and encode categorical variables.
Steps:
1. Extract additional features such as the length of the restaurant name and address using .str.len().
2. Create new features like "Has Table Booking" and "Has Online Delivery" by encoding categorical variables (Yes/No) to binary values (0 or 1).

Sample of New Features:
• Restaurant Name Length and Address Length are calculated for each restaurant.
• "Has Table Booking" and "Has Online Delivery" are encoded as binary values.


Visualization
Visualizations can be created to better understand the data and trends:
1. Average Rating by Price Range: Bar plot showing the average ratings across different price ranges.
2. Distribution of New Features: Visualize the length of restaurant names and addresses.
3. Online Delivery by Price Range: Stack bar chart to show the availability of online delivery across price ranges.


Usage
Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/restaurant-data-analysis.git
```

Install necessary dependencies:
